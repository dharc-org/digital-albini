# Digital Albini

Digital Albini is an ongoing project which aims to digitise, organise, study and disseminate Giuseppe Albini Archive. The project is conceived to investigate the interplay between humanistic culture, academic institutions, and political power in early twentieth-century Italy. Albini (1863–1933) - classical philologist, professor, Rector of the University of Bologna, and Senator of the Kingdom - offers a privileged vantage point from which to observe processes of cultural and institutional legitimation within the academic world between the liberal era and the Fascist regime. The project make use of semantic modelling to explictly organise the archival inventory into an interoperable knowledge graph.
